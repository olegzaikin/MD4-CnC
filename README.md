/src_jair - JAIR sources.

/solutions_jair - solutions found in the JAIR experiments.

### Sources

find_cnc_threshold.py - finds a threshold for cubing phase of Cube-and-Conquer.
For each threshold, a runtime estimation is calculated. This script can be
applied to an arbitrary CNF to estimate its hardness and/or to properly apply
Cube-and-Conquer.

boxplot_solvers.py - plots boxplots to visualise the estimations for thresholds.

sort_solution.py - sorts a given satisfying assignment by variable number,
extracts the first 512 bits (preimage) and converts them to a hex integer.

conquer.cpp (parallel_cubes.cpp in IJCAI sources) - multirhreaded implementation
of the conquer phase of Cube-and-Conquer.
