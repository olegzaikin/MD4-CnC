### About
Sources and benchmarks for the paper 'Inverting 43-step MD4 via Cube-and-Conquer' accepted to IJCAI-ECAI-2022.

### Directories overview

/cnfs - all CNFs used in the experiments, as well as TA-programs for the Transalg tool.

/src - sources.

### Sources

find_cnc_threshold.py - finds a threshold for cubing phase of Cube-and-Conquer.
For each threshold, a runtime estimation is calculated.
This script can be applied to an arbitrary CNF to estimate its hardness and/or
to properly apply Cube-and-Conquer.

boxplot_solvers.py - plots boxplots to visualise the estimations for thresholds.

parallel_cubes - multirhreaded implementation of the cubing phase of Cube-and-Conquer.
